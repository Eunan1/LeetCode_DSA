# Start of linked list = head
# End of linked list = tail

# Sentiel nodes sit at start and end of linked list to make oeprations and code
# needed to execute operations easier.

# They make it easier to travel along the list.
# The actual head = head.next and the actual tail is tail.prev
# Prevents errors adding to front and deleting from back
